# LOC Search Index — FlexSearch / LOC_KV

The Galaxy SQL Schema remains unchanged. This is an **optional index accelerator**, not a new SQL database, a new RLS rule, an RPC, or an MCP buffer. There is no data synchronization between independent SQL providers.

## Implemented

- FlexSearch version **0.8.212**, repo dependency from PR #1215. The index uses the same **CJK encoder** in Node backfill and Cloudflare Worker; versioned v2 keys prevent mixing older tokenization with new deltas.
- A private **loc-search-index Worker** bound to the existing Cloudflare **LOC_KV** namespace. The old MCP buffer Worker is not reused.
- Full document identity now **reuses PR #1219's virtual ZModel `LocFederatedRef`**. `locGlobalUid({databaseId,scopeId,uid})` produces the stable global UID, and FlexSearch adds `entityType` as an independent namespace. Two SQL sources with identical local UIDs never collide. Internal `databaseId` values are stable **lower-case** registry keys (for example, display label `DB1` can map to `db1`); they are independent of hosting vendors.
- Authenticated index operations: search, documents, snapshots, reset, coverage, bounded delta pruning and `POST /v1/status` (source readiness/segment counts). Service secret stays server-side. Coverage is now a **manifest listing every committed base-shard number**, not a bare `v2` flag. A remote KV point-of-presence that cannot yet read a listed shard triggers SQL fallback rather than treating the shard as empty.
- SQL Gateway accepts the optional search hint, obtains candidate UIDs through the index Worker, checks each returned `globalUid` against the **same ZModel federation contract**, then **still evaluates SQL content, publication, source, date and Scope permissions**. The index alone never grants content access.
- Search result keys and selected-article reads retain the logical database identifier; `expectedDbId` is **a verified routing assertion, never a browser-selected SQL connection**. A wrong database ID is rejected instead of returning a same-UID record from another source.
- Missing, incomplete, overloaded or unavailable index: original SQL search fallback.
- Gateway post-commit updates, MCP append/sync and short import write immutable delta segments. New Append content is indexed without rewriting a shared KV base shard. Old deleted or edited postings may remain as harmless candidates; SQL rechecks actual content.
- Initial indexing tool **scripts/rebuild-loc-search-index.mjs** scans authorized Galaxy once, stages 32 UID partitions in a temporary Node directory, and constructs **one FlexSearch shard at a time** before upload. It validates row count and duplicate UIDs *before* resetting the current index, cleans temporary files even on errors, and publishes a shard manifest only when every upload succeeds. The staging layer has five offline regression tests and uses no OpenNext.

## Boundaries

The SQL Gateway now has an **opt-in federated Galaxy text-search route**: one Scope can read multiple independent registered SQL datasets in one request, preserving colliding local UIDs as separate ZModel global IDs. The source list is a trusted server-side configuration, not a browser SQL target selector. All sources use their existing Kysely drivers and signed LOC Auth gate; cross-dataset date pagination uses an explicit SQL-portable NULLS LAST expression and a bounded k-way merge (max four concurrent SQL reads). There is no SQL replication or shared Galaxy table.

This is **not yet unrestricted SQL federation**: only the Search text-query shape and qualified Galaxy row lookup are handled. Culture/Trace/Statistics and deep search pages beyond the bounded 2,000-row window retain their existing routes or fail explicitly. For federated article details, **unqualified Anchor/Media/Time context is intentionally not attached**: mixing source-local Anchor or Media UIDs from the primary DB would be incorrect. Qualified Galaxy related-article title reads use the same `databaseId`; the remaining linked-data readers require a later dataset-aware route. Ordinary non-federated article details keep their existing functionality. A future user-facing hot-swap registration UI is not part of this change.

Cloudflare Workers KV is **eventually consistent**. A new index delta can lag a successful SQL commit, especially across regions. Even though SQL revalidation prevents stale/private content from being displayed, it cannot guarantee that an index has not temporarily omitted new matches. For that reason, **index-based narrowing is disabled by default**. Enable it only once full coverage, ingestion and acceptable freshness have been established. Strict read-after-write search requires a stronger consistency protocol than plain KV.

An index marked complete must cover all eligible documents, including private documents that might later become public. A public/anonymous-only backfill does not prove full coverage. Rebuilding requires a quiesced logical source or coordinated snapshot: the included builder assumes no concurrent mutation. The builder prunes only delta segments dated **before** the SQL scan's start, preserving newer append events; if a source reaches the per-source cap of 48 deltas, indexed narrowing falls back to SQL until a coordinated rebuild/compaction.

## Deployment / cutover (not automatic)

1. Retain existing LOC_KV. The former MCP buffer at workers/loc-channel1 and the loc-auth hourly Cron are unrelated to the new search tier; neither is modified or deleted by this PR. Decide their retirement separately.
2. Deploy workers/loc-search-index/wrangler.jsonc using the existing Wrangler workflow. Configure a random 32+ character, server-only **LOC_SEARCH_INDEX_SECRET** on that Worker; do not commit the secret.
3. On the **trusted LOC SQL Gateway**, set **LOC_SEARCH_INDEX_URL** to the HTTPS origin of the private Worker, and set the same **LOC_SEARCH_INDEX_SECRET**. The Cloudflare Container ingress forwards these variables to the Deno backend when configured.
4. For multiple independent SQL datasets, configure the trusted Gateway/container with **LOC_SEARCH_DATASETS_JSON** (see the example below), backed by existing **LOC_DB_CONNECTIONS_JSON** server-side profiles. Keep each user-defined logical ID stable and lower-case; never place passwords or URLs in the index.
5. Backfill each **logical dataset** separately with a signed **Scope manage** LOC SQL delegation, and environment **LOC_INDEX_SCOPE_ID**, **LOC_INDEX_DB_ID**, **LOC_SQL_GATEWAY_URL**, **LOC_SQL_DELEGATION_TOKEN**, plus index URL and secret. First run `LOC_INDEX_VERIFY_ONLY=true node scripts/rebuild-loc-search-index.mjs` to verify authorized SQL coverage and local shard sizing **without writing LOC_KV**. Then, with a quiesced dataset, run `node scripts/rebuild-loc-search-index.mjs`. The builder uses read-only **index-snapshot** Gateway requests with a private `x-loc-index-secret`, and stages on local temporary disk. All document UIDs are checked before updating the index. A successful build uploads only populated shards, prunes pre-scan deltas and publishes an explicit readiness manifest. `POST /v1/status` returns operational readiness without exposing articles.
6. The isolated, **non-deploying** GitHub Actions workflow `loc-flexsearch-index-tests.yml` runs all three suites: `node --test scripts/test-loc-search-index.mjs scripts/test-loc-federated-galaxy-search.mjs scripts/test-loc-search-index-stage.mjs`. Keep `LOC_SEARCH_INDEX_ENABLED` unset/false unless coverage and consistency have been verified; it is not automatically enabled by merging this PR.

Example **trusted server-only** logical source registry (never accepted from the browser):

```json
{
  "lo3rwang": [
    {"databaseId":"db1","provider":"supabase","engine":"postgres","connection_alias":"supabase_current"},
    {"databaseId":"db2","provider":"custom","engine":"mysql","connection_alias":"office_mysql"}
  ]
}
```

When a Scope has multiple registered datasets, a qualifying Galaxy content search fans out through the same Gateway, produces one globally ordered page, and keeps each source's `databaseId`. **Post-commit Galaxy, MCP Append and short-import index writes also resolve the stable `databaseId` from the trusted registry** before writing KV; they do not accidentally create a second, orphan index under the physical connection alias. A registered Scope whose configured SQL alias cannot be matched skips index ingestion rather than inventing a database identity. When the index is unavailable, every registered database is searched with the existing SQL content predicate; it does **not** silently search only the primary. Ordinary single-database behavior remains unchanged when the registry is absent. The qualified `expectedDbId` field is checked against this trusted registry (or the existing configured source in legacy mode), preventing same-UID collisions and wrong-database failover.

For public Galaxy text searches, the Gateway independently applies `search=true` plus private-site filtering; a dataset-qualified public article read applies `list=true` plus private-site filtering. Authorized Scope administrators continue to use their existing signed grant. These Kysely conditions are independent of native PostgreSQL RLS.

GitHub merges do **not** deploy a Worker, change server configuration or populate KV automatically. Secrets, routing configuration and Cloudflare deployment are separate steps.

## Workload and cost

- KV Free write and storage quotas are per account, not multiplied by Namespace or Worker.
- The Worker bounds results to 200 candidate IDs and each dataset to 48 immutable deltas; on limits, it returns incomplete and preserves SQL fallback rather than silently truncating.
- The Worker currently loads up to 32 base shard snapshots plus delta segments per search. Memory/latency against production volume **has not been measured**; do not claim a 1-second SLA without evidence.
- ZModel's `LocFederatedRef` and `LocAnchorLink` are **virtual types**, not automatically generated database policies. ZenStack's low-level **`$qb` bypasses `PolicyPlugin` policies**, even where a policy-aware client is created. The current fixed-control-model adapters therefore still rely on **the signed Gateway and Kysely filters** for effective access, not an assumed automatic policy SQL predicate. Galaxy row permissions remain the Gateway/Kysely responsibility until a separately validated policy-aware ORM cutover. No new RLS rules are necessary.
- A text index is not a substitute for SQL COUNT, Culture temporal aggregation, Trace geographic queries, SQL Gateway routing or LOC Auth.
