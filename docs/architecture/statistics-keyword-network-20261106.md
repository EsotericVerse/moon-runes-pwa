# Statistics / Keyword relationship editor — 2026-11-06

## Statistics (Recharts 3)

The prior statistics query and chart components remain in use. A shared `semanticStatisticChartTypes` selector checks the already-available chart capabilities against the metric's meaning, instead of offering ten interchangeable graphs. Temporal total/source data may use line, area, stacked, bar and (where meaningful) a moving-average composed view. Location, multimedia facets and keyword ranking share the same category/keyword statistical concept. Overlapping keyword/media hits cannot be safely presented as exclusive pie slices. Recharts' native `Brush` is enabled only for series with more than 32 time buckets. Results still come from the original bounded query; no new database round trips.

## Keyword editor (vis-network 10)

The existing Class → Group → Item → judging-word graph is now directly editable without leaving its tab: selection opens the same manual node editor alongside the graph. Empty Groups render, enabling direct creation of a new Item. The same managed-save/stale-analysis mechanisms and Edit Dock remain in charge. Arbitrary graph links and blind deletes are intentionally unavailable, preserving hierarchical data consistency.

The Network instance persists across node expansions; graph refresh keeps view/selection. Canvas colors are re-read from current published LOC Theme tokens on Theme changes. Narrow/mobile views use a vertical hierarchy, a stacked inspector and 44px-or-larger touch controls. The PELT suggestion button and analysis workflow remain unchanged.

**Boundaries:** front-end only. No new/modified SQL, RPC, Schema, indexes, ZModel, database drivers, authentication, or deployment workflows. Regression validation: pure chart selection tests plus real mobile/theme/browser verification after deployment.

## Statistic-first chart selection

A display is chosen by the question and the data, not by listing ten Recharts components. The first chart is automatic; manually selected alternatives remain available only if the underlying data supports them.

| Active statistic | Default | Meaningful alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope / LOC totals | time-series Line | total + moving-average Composed, Area, time-bucket Bar |
| Source / child-Scope activity | time-series Line | time-bucket Bar, Area, mutually exclusive source Stacked; Pie/Treemap only for bounded categorical composition |
| Place associations | ranked vertical Bar | location time trend Line or Area; never Pie/Stacked when an article may have more than one location |
| Keywords: Group / Item / mixed | ranked vertical Bar | Group trends Line/Area when actual dated Group counts exist; Item remains ranked without fabricated dated counts |
| Cross-member / cross-metric | multi-line time-series | grouped time-bucket Bar; Scatter only for two varying numerical series; no stacking of overlapping measures |

The legacy multimedia facet component remains unmounted: the active Statistics page deliberately uses totals, source, location and keywords. Do not reactivate deprecated media statistics merely to make a module appear utilized. Overlapping keyword/media counts and cross-comparison lanes never masquerade as additive stacked areas or exclusive slices.

Automatic defaults use the existing shared selector. The data queries, time windows, Kysely, authorization, database Schema, RPC and export logic are unchanged. Browser/Node verification must still be recorded separately from source inspection.

## Multi-Class keyword analytics (2026-11-06)

Multimedia, locations and other future categories are configured by the owner **inside the existing Keyword tree**. The site must not infer their Class IDs from words such as “media” or “place”, invent data, or create separate statistical types before those classifications exist. Statistics exposes the full authorized Keyword Class selector. Culture exposes its full authorized Class selector, with Category / Class labels when available.

The Keywords management **reanalysis** tab has an explicit Class selector; it passes that exact Class UID to the unchanged classifier and writes results only for that Class. Its completion metadata is keyed under the existing `keyword_meta.by_class[Class UID]`; counts now include `matchedDocuments`, `analyzedDocuments`, `itemMatches` and `occurrences`, alongside `completedAt`. A different Class is neither cleared nor implicitly reanalyzed. This is the existing JSON metadata field, not a new Schema/Anchor attribute. The single `current_keyword_class_uid` remains the default selection, not a limit on how many Classes can be analyzed or viewed.

Existing Keyword Group and Item summaries remain governed by their actual Class UID and the existing authorization. No new RPC, table, index, Article content search or additional independent media/place aggregation is introduced. Counts must come from an actual completed analysis; a Class not yet analyzed has no result.

## Class-scoped last analysis date (2026-11-06)

The Keywords **重新分析** dropdown enumerates all editable Classes, including each Class's own last completion date or `未解析`. Selecting a Class changes the visible last-run date and count; clicking Analyze runs exactly that Class with the existing classifier.

`keyword_meta.by_class[Class UID].completedAt` is the **only** authoritative completion date. Its sibling count fields are scoped to the same UID. The historical Scope-level `staticstime` is not a shared completion date and is no longer used for Class readiness in the frontend or Kysely analytics. Existing update paths clear the old mirror instead of writing the selected Class's timestamp into a Scope-global value. Legacy records with only a Scope-wide date are treated as `未解析` until that Class is analyzed again; dates must not be guessed or copied between Classes.

No new columns, tables, RPC, indexes or changes to keyword matching rules.

## Public Statistics / Culture / Trace first-paint sitemap (2026-11-06)

**Statistics homepage (every Scope, including LOC):** `FeaturePage('statics')` already loads the published Hero through `heroBlocks(scopeId,'statics')`, the existing `hero_blocks` public action; do not request Manage just to rediscover a known Scope. First numeric request is **one rolling Taipei year only** (`statisticsTaipeiYearWindow` / `statisticsZoomWindow`), returning the article total and source-category daily counts. Do not start at the nearest/latest saved Era, await Era metadata, auto-open a Keyword Class, or issue an all-history MIN(date) scan. The optional source-category configuration is deferred from the total homepage. The only longer time query is an Era/Period *explicitly selected by the visitor*.

**Culture homepage:** The initial lower classification/keyword-density date envelope and the upper saved-time viewport both start at that same rolling year; no default Era selection. A visitor may explicitly switch to a saved Period/Era. An ordinary Culture visit must not auto-trigger Keyword Class analysis from saved UI display preferences. The time-structure reader still preserves saved Anchors/Periods for explicit interaction; the one-year requirement governs the first displayed interval and its numeric counts.

**LOC Culture:** Read the published Culture member IDs once, synthesize the same one-year display window for members, and do **not** fetch all members' Eras or compute union/intersection windows to decide the homepage. On opening the density detail, query each member's **same one-year** date interval and display its daily count; no common-overlap filter. LOC Statistics likewise queries that single year, without separate oldest-date scans per member.

**Trace:** The map index reads saved `path`/`trace`, and selected or referenced `point` Anchors only. There is no eager Galaxy article-list query or keyword/media analysis on page open. Only opening a selected anchor (or explicit deep link) mounts `TracePlaceResults`, whose article reader applies indexed `place_id` filters for that anchor or its path members. The existing Hero path is `heroBlocks(scopeId,'trace')`. No standalone media statistics were added.

No new tables, schema fields, indexes or RPCs; the existing Hero and Kysely read paths are reused. Static/source-level and isolated JavaScript contract checks were performed, while full browser and live-database timing still require deployed-runtime evidence.
